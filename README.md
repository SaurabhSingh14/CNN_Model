# CNN_Model
A Deep Learning Model (CNN) which can identify whether a given image is of Dog or Cat.

Dataset is divided into 3 parts: Training dataset, Testing dataset, and Single Prediction. 
Training and testing dataset is further subdivided into 2 parts 'dogs' and 'cats' respectively which includes different pictures of dogs and cats.

Single Prediction includes few images of 'dogs' and 'cats' which are required to get predicted by the trained CNN algorithm.

Dataset is not uploaded here due to its huge size.

Tools Used: Numpy, Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib.
